    <string name="pandas_grading_privacy_policy_page_title">Privacy Policy</string>
    <string name="pandas_grading_privacy_policy_page_privacy_policy_1"><![CDATA[<p>\'GREEN PANDA SINGLE-MEMBER PRIVATE COMPANY\' respects and protects your privacy and your personal data. This Privacy Policy applies every time you use the services offered to you through the \'WebApp\' application in order (i) to evaluate your electronic device, (ii) to provide of a financial offer on a case-by-case basis - if you decide to make a financial transaction, or (iii) to final issue a coupon that will incorporate the amount of the financial offer corresponding to the value of the electronic device as obtained during the above mentioned evaluation, which can be used exclusively for the purchase of products from the store of our partner enterprises that use the \'WebApp\' on behalf of our company and in accordance with the terms and conditions incorporated therein, or (iv) to pay you the agreed price corresponding to the value of your electronic device as obtained during the above mentioned evaluation, if you finally make it available to our company (\'financial transaction\'). The protection of your Personal Data is governed by the legal framework <strong>of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of the EU (hereinafter \'GDPR\'), as well as by the Greek law no. 4624/2019</strong> \'Personal Data Protection Authority, measures for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of data" as currently in force.<br /><br />For the purposes of the applicable legislation, Controller shall mean the company under the name <strong>\'GREEN PANDA SINGLE-MEMBER PRIVATE COMPANY\'</strong> having its registered office at 20 Charitos Street, P.C. 10675, Athens with GCR No 150229702000 <strong>(hereinafter referred to as \'our company\', \'we\', \'our\', \'ours\')</strong> and our purpose is to provide you with the most information possible regarding any form of processing of your personal data (e.g. collection, storage, etc.) as well as to inform you of your rights.<br /><br /></p><h4><u>1. CATEGORIES OF DATA COLLECTED BY US</u></h4><br/>A) <u>Your Identification Data:</u> Full Name, phone number, email address. This information is collected directly from you at the pre-contractual and contractual stage, i.e. the moment you accept the financial offer as resulted from the pricing of your electronic device using the "Trade-In App".<br/><br/>B) <u>Information about your device:</u><br/>a) The unique identifier of your mobile device ("IMEI number"). The IMEI number is collected during the evaluation phase of your electronic device in order to subsequently form a corresponding financial offer for selling it and, at the stage of issuance of the coupon, if you choose to make a financial transaction, to make it possible to match the financial offer with the electronic device sold in order to be credited to you, through the issuance and delivery of the coupon, with the corresponding amount for purchases of equal value in the stores of our partner enterprises. Also the IMEI number is used by our company in order to confirm whether the coupon you have received with the financial offer for the value of your device was redeemed or expired or still remains active for redemption. To the extent that the above IMEI number or similar identifiers or similar information derived therefrom may be interpreted as, or become, personal data in accordance with the relevant applicable law, we undertake to treat such information as personal data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br/>b) Information about the functionality of some other components of your device which are biometrics, camera front/back, audio (microphone/speaker), digitizer. To collect this information, the "WebApp" will request you to provide us with the required access on the camera (capture front/back side photos from your device), biometrics, audio functionalities of your device. The information that will be collected will be stored and used solely for the purpose of evaluating your device\'s condition.<br/><br/>C) <u>Your financial data:</u> If you make a financial transaction and only at this stage we collect your International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and/or your bank debit or credit card number.<br/><br/><h4><u>2. OUR PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING YOUR DATA</u></h4><br/>-To take measures at your request at the pre-contractual stage, i.e. for the issuance of the relevant coupon that will incorporate the amount of the financial offer accepted by you and which coupon may be used in accordance with the terms and conditions incorporated therein. The coupon will also be sent in electronic form to the email address (email) indicated by you.<br/><br/>- For the final and smooth preparation of the contract, namely: (a) either by redeeming your coupon by purchasing products from the stores of our partner enterprises and selling your electronic device to us through our partner enterprises acting as our agents, (b) or by paying you the agreed price (value of your electronic device) and corresponding sale of your electronic device to us or through our partner enterprises acting as our agents.<br/><br/>- To safeguard your legitimate interests and the protection of transactions in general, i.e. for the purpose of identifying you during the performance of the contract. Your adequate identification serves your protection against fraudulent behavior by third parties in case of loss of your electronic device or coupon (double authentication: device owner but also coupon owner).<br/><br/>- To comply with our legal obligations, if we receive a respective legal request for the transmission of such personal data to the competent police or prosecutorial/judicial or supervisory authorities and for the purpose of our compliance with the applicable legislation or for our compliance with the commercial or tax legislation, etc.<br/><br/>- To comply with our legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6 para. 1 (f) of the GDPR and provided that such collection does not constitute a breach of your individual rights and freedoms (i.e. processing is preceded by a relative weighting of interests). Specifically, the said data is collected in particular and primarily for the purpose of protecting transactions and preventing or prosecuting criminal or other offences (e.g. fraud, embezzlement, acceptance and placing on market the proceeds of crime, etc.).<br/><br/>- With your consent, we use your data to send you information (newsletter), for advertising purposes, direct marketing. We would like to inform you that by accepting this Privacy Policy you give us your explicit consent to use, collect and store your data for the above mentioned purpose (sending information material, advertising, direct marketing). In any case, you have the right to withdraw your consent by email at contact@pandas.io or simply by clicking "unsubscribe" in the corresponding emails you will receive.<br/><br/><h4><u>3. TRANSMISSION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES</u></h4><br/>Our company may transmit your data strictly to our necessary personnel, who are bound by a relevant obligation of confidentiality as well as to our partner companies or third party service providers, who process your data as Processors on behalf and in accordance with our orders.<br/><br/><strong>Our staff or our affiliates</strong> process your data solely for the purpose of the initial evaluation of your device and its relevant control, the provision to you of the proposed financial offer, the issuance of a relevant coupon if you accept the relevant offer, the execution of a financial transaction, and in general for the purpose of the successful implementation of our contract. Our partner enterprises are always selected on the basis of, among other things, the high degree of protection they provide regarding the security of personal data.<br/><br/><strong>Third party service providers</strong> are companies that have been charged with the task of managing, maintaining and developing the technical features of the software incorporated in the WebApp and our servers in general, as well as with the task of hosting, managing and maintaining your data (hosting platforms/servers). Companies providing such services have been carefully selected and have experienced, competent and reliable staff and operate on the basis of all relevant requirements, specifications and rules set by the existing legislative framework.<br/><br/>Other recipients of your data may be the Financial Institutions or other institutions for executing payment orders through which our financial transaction is implemented.<br/><br/>The Processors have agreed and contractually committed with our Company to observe a duty of confidentiality, not to share your data with third parties without our Company\'s permission, to process your data exclusively for the agreed processing purposes, to take appropriate technical and organizational security measures and in general to comply with the legal provisions on the protection of personal data in order to maintain a high level of their security.<br/><br/>Please contact us by sending an email to contact@pandas.io, if you want to receive a complete list of partner enterprises.<br/><br/>We reserve the right to share your personal data in cases where such disclosure is required by law or imposed by other competent supervisory, monitoring, independent, judicial, public and/or other authorities or is required for purposes prescribed by law, for which the individual\'s consent is not required (e.g. contribution to the prevention or investigation of fraud, to protect our legitimate interests and/or our property, etc.).<br/><br/>The processing of your personal data takes place within Greece and the European Union (EU). In case we cooperate with companies outside the EU, we will protect your data in the way described in this Privacy Policy and your data will only be processed upon instruction given by us and only in case there is an adequacy decision by the European Commission or if the appropriate safeguards (binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses, approved code of conduct, etc.) are agreed which ensure a high level of security in relation to the processing of your personal data.<br/><br/>There is a possibility that our company processes personal data of third parties, which are transmitted directly to us by the users of the \'WebApp\', such as when the customer presenting the electronic device for its pricing and sale is different from the owner of the electronic device.<br/><br/>Under these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the customer/user who appears as the owner of the electronic device during the use of the trade-in app in general to have received the prior express/written consent by the owner before disclosing his/her personal data to our company (full name, account details, etc.) and to inform him/her about this Privacy Policy, because the customer/user will be solely responsible for the transmission of the information and personal data of a third party who has not given his/her consent or in case such data is used in an illegal or inappropriate manner. Our company expressly disclaims any relevant liability that may arise from such unlawful or unfair use. In any case, any third party whose personal data is processed by our company under such circumstances has the same rights as those described in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy under the heading \'Your Rights\'.<br/><br/><h4><u>4. RETENTION PERIOD OF DATA KEPT BY US</u></h4><br/>The retention period that we keep your personal data depends on the time required in order to provide you with the services you have selected (e.g. payment of money for the sale of your electronic device) and any relevant legitimate business purpose. Generally, when your personal data is no longer needed for legitimate business purposes or reasons, your personal data will be securely deleted and destroyed and/or can be anonymised in a shorter time to make them unidentifiable with your person.<br/><br/>In particular, when you choose to make a financial transaction and a final sale of your electronic device, we store your personal data for five (5) years from the execution of the contract between us.<br/><br/>Especially for the personal data we collect based on your consent, these are kept for as long as the relevant consent has been given or until its revocation if this occurs earlier.<br/><br/>Otherwise, and only exceptionally, we may retain your personal data for a longer period of time even after the termination of the relationship between us and the expiration of the deadlines for the exercise of the relevant rights that may arise therefrom (e.g. expiration of the coupon containing the financial offer, withdrawal from the contract, etc.), in order to comply with our legal interests as defined above (e.g. crime prevention or suppression) or with another legal obligation upon a relevant request from competent Public Authorities.<br/><br/><h4><u>5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA/SECURITY MEASURES</u></h4><br/>We introduce Appropriate Technical and Organizational Measures (\'ATOM\') of Security that are sufficient to minimize the risks of destruction, loss or alteration of data - even accidentally -, to prevent unauthorized access and dissemination of your personal information data, as well as to prevent illegal processing methods and types of processing that are not in accordance with the collection purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and, finally, that ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your data and aim to minimize their processing.<br/><br/>However, we cannot guarantee that the ATOMs introduced in relation to the collection of your data and their possible transmission to third parties, limit or exclude any risk of unauthorized access or dissemination of data during the evaluation stage of your device, as the protection of your data depends on you as well.<br/><br/><h4><u>6. YOUR RIGHTS</u></h4><br/>You have the right, at any time, to access your personal data, details and information that yourself have disclosed to our business (right of access).<br/><br/>You have the right to request the updating, correction and modification of your personal data (right of correction).<br/><br/>You have the right to request the deletion and permanent elimination of your personal data in whole or in part (right of deletion) (if e.g. the data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected, etc.).<br/><br/>You have the right to request the conversion into an anonymous form or blocking of your personal data used, including data that is considered unnecessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or subsequently processed (right to restrict processing).<br/><br/>You have the right to request that your personal data be transferred to another data controller in a secure manner (right to portability).<br/><br/>In any case, you have the right to object in whole or in part (right to object) to any further processing other than those expressly mentioned above.<br/><br/>You may freely exercise your rights at any time by sending a written request to our company at dpo@greenpanda.io and/or by sending a registered letter to 20 Charitos st., P.C. 10675, Athens, and we will respond immediately to your request.<br/><br/>We strive to respond to all legitimate customer/user requests within one month from the date of submission thereof. Occasionally it may take longer than a month, taking into account the complexity of your request and the number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and inform you accordingly. However, in the event that your request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, we can either impose a reasonable charge, which we will inform you of, or refuse to respond to your request.<br/><br/>If you believe that your rights are being infringed in any way, you can also submit a complaint to the competent Supervisory Authority:<br/><br/>Hellenic Data Protection Authority<br/><br/>Postal Address: 1‚Äì3 Kifissias Avenue, P.C. 115 23, Athens<br/><br/>Call Center: +30‚Äì210 6475600<br/><br/>Fax: +30‚Äì210 6475628<br/><br/>E-mail: contact@dpa.gr<br/><br/><h4><u>7.

Any such amendments and updates to the Privacy Policy will be posted on the "Trade-In App" and communicated to you in this way so that they will be binding as soon as they are published there, and take effect from the moment of your next visit. We therefore invite you to visit this section every time you use our services and this application to read the latest and updated version of our Privacy Policy.<br/><br/><h4><u>8.

    <string name="pandas_grading_our_story_page_article_content"><![CDATA[Our smartphones do so much for us. They even bring us closer to our\n          next smartphone. And our next one. And the one after that. And so on.\n          But what happens each time we switch devices for a newer model? We\n          collect our own personal collection of devices. Believe us, we\n          checked: <strong>around 1 billion smartphones are left unused! </strong>\n          So, whether it\'s hidden away somewhere in our house or buried in a\n          junkyard, it\'s still e-waste that needs to be managed in a sustainable\n          way. <br />\n          <br /> <strong>This may not come as news.</strong> <br /> <br />\n          Do you know what did come as a surprise to us? If everything can be\n          done in <strong>a matter of minutes</strong> smartphone in our hands (and\n          we will most likely find to be outdated in a year or so) shouldn\'t\n          there be a convenient and sustainable way to get rid of used, broken,\n          or outdated smartphones? I mean, we couldn\'t grasp the idea that there\n          was no easy way to do it. Just like there\'s a real-time way to do\n          practically anything from a smartphone there must be a‚Äî‚Äî AHA! Right\n          there and then, <strong>2020 became the year of Pandas</strong> \uD83C\uDF89 We set\n          out, myself Vratskides, (my partner in trade-in) to craft a software\n          solution allowing users to automatically trade in a smartphone, get\n          paid for it while also benefiting the planet. <br />\n          <br /> This solution was destined to work through a custom wireless\n          identification process, eradicating all the hassle and awkwardness of\n          hand-to-hand trade-ins or long waits on offer updates and evaluations.\n          From day one of our Research and Development, we devoted ourselves to\n          streamlining the entire process making it super-fast and easy every\n          step of the way. We obsessed, we told ourselves we had to make it work\n          in 5 minutes. <strong>So we got it down to 3\'</strong> \uD83E\uDD18 And that was\n          only the beginning‚Ä¶ Next, stop? Make trade-in available to as many\n          people as possible, by partnering with retailers and creating\n          frictionless user journeys across channels through next-gen tech and\n          AI.\n          <br />\n          <br /> Just like that (almost automagically) we became a team of 30\n          awesome Pandas \uD83D\uDE4C with 70 locations in 7 cities and two countries,\n          within our very first year. And in that very year, approximately\n          10,000 trade-ins later, we saved 650 tons of CO2e and 1.8 tons of\n          e-waste.\n          <br />\n          <br /> Humankind may have a long way to go when it comes to processing\n          e-waste but we are determined to do our part one trade-in at a time,\n          making the latest technology accessible to more and more people. \n \n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <strong>Fanis Koutouvelis</strong>\n          <br />\n          Founder of Pandas]]></string>
